## Technologies Used

### Backend
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript runtime environment to build a **RESTful** API
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store and access data as JSON documents
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) web application framework to handle routing requests
* [FFmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg) multimedia framework to decode, encode, filter and send video clips
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) framework for testing JS applications
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) Assertion library, also used for helping test JS applications
* [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) Using the Google Cloud Speech API in order to transcribe recordings into code
* [Web Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) Used in order to do all the heavy stuff on other threads to ensure that the server doesn't take too long to process items

### Frontend
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library to develop an interactive UI
* [Interact.js](http://interactjs.io/) to improve drag and drop, and other gesture-based interactions
* [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) API to render/process edits and effects using client-side GPU


## Challenges
1. Avoiding load on server wherever possible by making full use of client-side resources, including client GPU
2. Clipping at interframes instead of keyframes without lag for rendering
3. Pre- and post-processing effects applied across clips and source media, integrating various codecs for flexibilty of input/output formats
4. Synchronizing audio- and video-channels in the rendered video as aligned in the editor
5. Simplification of a user interface with many features entry-level users do not need, while maintaining ready access to those features
